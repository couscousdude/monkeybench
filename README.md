This guide is built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), [mdBook-quiz](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/mdbook-quiz), and [mdBook-alerts](https://github.com/lambdalisue/rs-mdbook-alerts).  
To get started, ensure you have the latest version of Rust installed and then run:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
cargo install mdbook-quiz
cargo install mdbook-alerts
```

You can start a development server with:

```sh
mdbook serve
```

These will likely be refactored into scripts in the future.  
Right now, we ain't got that kind of time.
