Congratulations on completing the MonkeyBench examination! You've taken the first

## How your application will be reviewed

After you click the submit button, itâ€™s easy to feel like your
application has entered a black hole. So what really happens between
when you apply and when you receive your decision?

Once your application is complete, it will first be read by a senior
admissions officer who will consider your application in a holistic
manner, within its proper context. Strong applications will then be
evaluated by additional admissions officers, who will summarize it for
the Admissions Committee.

These summaries, along with your entire application, will then go to the
selection committee, where multiple groups of different admissions staff
and faculty members will weigh in. At least a dozen people will
significantly discuss and debate an application before it is placed in
the admit pile.

## What happens next?

After the selection committee has reviewed your application, we will
contact you with the final decision. Good luck!
