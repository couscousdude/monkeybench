# MonkeyBench: The Team 1280 Controls/Programming Lead Qualifying Exam

Preliminary qualification test for the programming and controls lead positions.

## Preamble

Before beginning this examination, you may wish to know the answers to a
few commonly asked questions:

1. What is this exam designed to test you on?  
   <br />
   This exam is merely a qualifying test to determine whether an applicant
   meets a threshold of prerequisite knowledge to effectively manage and
   maintain the health of Team 1280's codebase, especially in critical
   moments like during competition. The test will contain basic questions
   about version control (Git), common command-line tools, and basic
   knowledge of programming.

2. Why is this exam necessary?  
    <br />
   Simply put, the skillset required to merely to write code is
   different from the skillset required to _coordinate an entire codebase._
   We value the latter more heavily because it's much easier to pick up the
   former "on the job".

3. How will this exam be graded?  
   <br /> The exam will be graded manually, but you may receive
   immediate feedback for multiple choice and some short answer
   questions. You may be given the option to reattempt each section if
   you answer incorrectly, but this is at the discretion of the exam
   proctor. **You should not retry any quiz sections without
   permission**, as this may result in the cancellation of your score by
   your proctor and possible disqualification from consideration for the
   position. Each question is worth 1 point, unless otherwise indicated.
   The exam will be scored out of the total amount of points available.

4. What score is necessary to pass the exam?  
   <br /> A score of 80% or higher will automatically result in a
   qualifying (passing) score. If you score below this threshold, you may
   still be considered for the leadership position! We know you're more
   than just your test scores. Using a process called comprehensive
   review, we look at how hard you've worked to take advantage of the
   opportunities you've had to excel in the team, in your favorite
   extracurricular activities and in your community.
