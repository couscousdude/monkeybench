# Section 1: Version control

This section will test you on your knowledge of version control systems,
specifically Git. This is an essential skill for anyone in a
programming-adjacent leadership position, as it allows you to reconcile
and maintain contributions from multiple team members without breaking
the codebase or losing their progress. You will be tested on your
knowledge of fundamental commands and operations in Git.
