# Section 2: Basic Command Line

This section will test you on your comfortability with basic command
line usage. This is another essential skill, as you will commonly need
to enter the terminal to wage war against the demons of Java and Gradle,
as well as other tasks like operating the `git` CLI and other general
operations. You will be tested on your knowledge of fundamental commands
and operations in the command line, mainly centered around `sh` derived
shells like `bash` and `zsh`, but also `nushell` and `PowerShell`.
