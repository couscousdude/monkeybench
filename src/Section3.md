# Section 3: Technical Exam

This is the technical portion of the interview. You will be asked to
complete a series of basic data structure and algorithm challenges in
whatever language you choose. You may enter your code within our
web-based IDEs below for Python or JavaScript, or you may use your own
language and IDE and copy-paste the code into the text box.

**Note:** You must use a Chromium-based browser to load the web-based
IDEs.

## Challenge 1: Multiples of 3 or 5
